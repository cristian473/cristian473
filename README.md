### Hi there visitor! 👋


My name is Cristian Morales, and i really like programming. I belive that all the world should know about computer programming becouse you are going to think and resolve ideas faster and more efficiently.

I speak Spanish and some English. I’m searching a remote job in any country, preferably USA. Aslo i’m taking english lessons to keep better conversations :)

I’m currently learning Full stack web development at “Soy Henry”, an argentinian programming academy. I’ve learned the bases of javascript and web development, back-end and front-end completely from zero ussing React and Redux, also NodeJS, Express and Sequelize to Databases.

I’m currently working on a SPA E-Commerce at Henry academy, as final proyect. Also, as a personal project, I am doing a Mobile-App to help people to talk about their problems. Users called “helpers” can apply to be helpers, and listen the problems of other people. All this voluntarily. I’m doing this App with React-Native for the front-end and I still don’t start with backend, but i’m going to use nodeJS
