### Hi there visitor! 👋


My name is Cristian Morales, and i really like programming. I belive that all the world should know about computer programming becouse you are going to think and resolve ideas faster and more efficiently.

I speak Spanish and some English. I’m searching a remote job in any country, preferably USA. Aslo i’m taking english lessons to keep better conversations :)

I learned Full stack web development at “Soy Henry”, an argentinian programming academy. I’ve learned the bases of javascript and web development, back-end and front-end completely from zero ussing React and Redux, also NodeJS, Express and Sequelize to Databases.

I’m currently working on UMA Health, an app to connect people with doctors, keep medical consultations, generate prescriptions, save my prescriptions, like a "pocket doctor". Also, here work like Full Stack Developer, using React hooks and redux in front-end, and nodeJS, express and firebase in back-end.
